  unpacking elements something and the putting them into standalong variables

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [varName1, varName2] = arrayName

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  creating literals has the name of the variable on the left of the assignment operator and then the literal object or array with the [] or {} brackets on the right side. Destructuring has the [] or {} brackets on the left side of the assignment operator and the name of the object or array the values come from on the right side
